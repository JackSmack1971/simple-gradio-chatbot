# Incident Response Guide

## Overview
This guide provides procedures for responding to incidents affecting the Personal AI Chatbot system. An incident is any unplanned interruption or degradation of service.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels
- **ðŸ”´ SEV-0**: Complete system outage, data loss, security breach
- **ðŸŸ¡ SEV-1**: Significant degradation, major feature unavailable
- **ðŸŸ¢ SEV-2**: Minor issues, partial degradation
- **ðŸ”µ SEV-3**: Low impact issues, monitoring alerts

### Impact Assessment
- **Customer Impact**: Number of users affected
- **Business Impact**: Revenue/efficiency impact
- **Technical Impact**: System components affected

## Immediate Response (First 5 minutes)

### 1. Acknowledge the Incident
```bash
# Check system status
python scripts/health/health_check.py --verbose

# Check recent logs
tail -f data/logs/app.log

# Check system resources
top -p $(pgrep -f "python.*main.py")
```

### 2. Assess Impact
- Check user-facing services
- Review error rates and response times
- Identify affected components
- Determine scope of impact

### 3. Communicate
- Notify team via incident channel
- Update status page if applicable
- Inform stakeholders for SEV-0/1 incidents

## Investigation (Next 15-30 minutes)

### 4. Gather Information
```bash
# Collect system metrics
python scripts/health/health_check.py --json > incident_metrics.json

# Check application logs
grep -i "error\|exception\|fail" data/logs/app.log | tail -20

# Check system logs
journalctl -u personal-ai-chatbot -n 50 --no-pager

# Check network connectivity
ping -c 5 openrouter.ai
```

### 5. Identify Root Cause
Common causes to check:
- API rate limiting (OpenRouter)
- Network connectivity issues
- Memory/CPU exhaustion
- Database corruption
- Configuration errors
- External service outages

### 6. Implement Workarounds
For common issues:
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff
- **Memory Issues**: Restart application
- **Network Issues**: Check proxy/firewall settings

## Resolution (Next 30-60 minutes)

### 7. Execute Fix
Based on root cause:

#### API Rate Limiting
```bash
# Check current rate limit status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
     https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/auth/key

# Implement backoff in application
# Update rate limiter configuration
```

#### Memory Exhaustion
```bash
# Restart application gracefully
systemctl restart personal-ai-chatbot

# Check memory usage after restart
python scripts/health/health_check.py --check memory_usage
```

#### Network Issues
```bash
# Check DNS resolution
nslookup openrouter.ai

# Test API connectivity
curl -X POST https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model":"anthropic/claude-3-haiku","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"test"}]}'
```

### 8. Verify Fix
```bash
# Run comprehensive health check
python scripts/health/health_check.py

# Monitor for 10 minutes
watch -n 30 'python scripts/health/health_check.py --json | jq .overall_status'
```

## Post-Incident Activities

### 9. Document Incident
Create incident report including:
- Timeline of events
- Root cause analysis
- Resolution steps
- Prevention measures

### 10. Implement Prevention
- Update monitoring thresholds
- Improve error handling
- Add automated tests
- Update runbooks

### 11. Review and Improve
- Conduct post-mortem meeting
- Update incident response procedures
- Implement monitoring improvements

## Escalation Procedures

### When to Escalate
- **SEV-0**: Immediate escalation to management
- **SEV-1**: Escalate after 30 minutes if not resolved
- **SEV-2**: Escalate after 2 hours if not resolved

### Escalation Contacts
- **Technical Lead**: [Contact Info]
- **Engineering Manager**: [Contact Info]
- **External Support**: OpenRouter support team
