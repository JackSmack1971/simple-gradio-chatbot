# Disaster Recovery Procedures - Personal AI Chatbot

## Overview

This document outlines disaster recovery procedures for the Personal AI Chatbot application. These procedures ensure business continuity and data recovery in case of system failures, data corruption, or catastrophic events.

## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours for critical systems, 24 hours for full service restoration
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour for configuration data, 24 hours for conversation data
- **Data Retention**: 30 days for automated backups, 90 days for manual backups

## Emergency Contacts

- **Primary Contact**: System Administrator
- **Secondary Contact**: Development Team Lead
- **Emergency Hotline**: [Emergency Contact Information]

## Disaster Scenarios and Recovery Procedures

### Scenario 1: Application Process Failure

**Symptoms:**
- Application is not responding
- HTTP endpoint returns errors
- Users cannot access the chat interface

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check application logs: `tail -f $DATA_DIR/logs/app.log`
2. Verify system resources: `python scripts/deployment/validation/health-check.py`
3. Restart application: `./run.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `.\run.bat` (Windows)

**Recovery Steps:**
1. Stop any running processes: `pkill -f "python.*main.py"`
2. Clear temporary files: `rm -rf /tmp/personal-ai-chatbot-*`
3. Restart application with clean state
4. Verify functionality using health check script

### Scenario 2: Data Corruption

**Symptoms:**
- Application starts but behaves unexpectedly
- Configuration errors in logs
- Conversation data appears corrupted

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Stop the application immediately
2. Do not attempt to restart without backup restoration
3. Identify corruption scope (config vs. conversation data)

**Recovery Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Stop application
pkill -f "python.*main.py"

# 2. Create emergency backup of current state
./scripts/deployment/backup/create-backup.sh --type data --full

# 3. Restore from last known good backup
./scripts/deployment/backup/restore-backup.sh --dry-run  # First test
./scripts/deployment/backup/restore-backup.sh           # Then restore

# 4. Verify data integrity
python scripts/deployment/validation/validate-config.py

# 5. Restart application
./run.sh
```

### Scenario 3: Configuration Loss

**Symptoms:**
- Application fails to start with configuration errors
- API keys or settings are missing
- "Configuration file not found" errors

**Recovery Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Restore configuration backup
./scripts/deployment/backup/restore-backup.sh --backup-file path/to/config-backup.tar.gz

# 2. Verify configuration
python scripts/deployment/validation/validate-config.py

# 3. Update API keys in .env file if needed
nano $DATA_DIR/.env

# 4. Restart application
./run.sh
```

### Scenario 4: System Hardware Failure

**Symptoms:**
- Complete system unavailability
- Disk failure or corruption
- Operating system issues

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **Prepare Recovery Environment:**
   - Set up identical hardware or virtual machine
   - Install same operating system version
   - Configure network settings

2. **Restore System:**
   ```bash
   # Install Personal AI Chatbot
   ./scripts/deployment/linux/install.sh  # Linux
   # or ./scripts/deployment/macos/install.sh  # macOS
   # or .\scripts\deployment\windows\install.ps1  # Windows

   # Restore latest full backup
   ./scripts/deployment/backup/restore-backup.sh
   ```

3. **Verify System:**
   - Run health checks
   - Test application functionality
   - Verify data integrity

### Scenario 5: Security Breach

**Symptoms:**
- Unauthorized access detected
- Suspicious log entries
- Unexpected system behavior

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Disconnect from network if breach suspected
2. Preserve all logs and evidence
3. Notify security team immediately

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **Isolate System:**
   - Disconnect from network
   - Disable remote access
   - Change all passwords and API keys

2. **Assess Damage:**
   - Review access logs
   - Check for unauthorized changes
   - Verify data integrity

3. **Clean Recovery:**
   ```bash
   # Complete system reset
   rm -rf $DATA_DIR
   ./scripts/deployment/[platform]/uninstall.sh
   ./scripts/deployment/[platform]/install.sh

   # Restore from clean backup
   ./scripts/deployment/backup/restore-backup.sh --backup-file [trusted-backup]
   ```

4. **Security Hardening:**
   ```bash
   # Reapply security measures
   ./scripts/deployment/config/security/harden-permissions.sh
   ./scripts/deployment/config/security/setup-firewall.sh
   ./scripts/deployment/config/security/validate-security.sh
   ```

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups
- **Frequency**: Daily for data, weekly for full system
- **Retention**: 7 daily backups, 4 weekly backups
- **Storage**: Local storage with optional cloud replication
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data

### Manual Backups
- **Trigger**: Before major updates or configuration changes
- **Retention**: 90 days
- **Storage**: External media or cloud storage

### Backup Verification
```bash
# Test backup integrity
./scripts/deployment/backup/restore-backup.sh --dry-run

# Validate backup contents
python scripts/deployment/validation/test-deployment.py
```

## Recovery Testing

### Regular Testing Schedule
- **Monthly**: Restore from backup test
- **Quarterly**: Full disaster recovery simulation
- **Annually**: Complete system recovery test

### Testing Procedures
```bash
# 1. Create test environment
# 2. Restore backup to test environment
./scripts/deployment/backup/restore-backup.sh --backup-file [test-backup]

# 3. Run validation tests
python scripts/deployment/validation/test-deployment.py
python scripts/deployment/validation/health-check.py

# 4. Document results
# 5. Update recovery procedures if needed
```

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication
- **Immediate**: Slack/Teams notification to team
- **1 hour**: Email update to stakeholders
- **4 hours**: Detailed incident report
- **24 hours**: Recovery status and timeline

### External Communication
- **Customer Impact**: Notify affected users
- **Service Status**: Update status page
- **Resolution**: Communicate when service restored

## Prevention Measures

### Proactive Monitoring
```bash
# Health monitoring
python scripts/deployment/validation/health-check.py --watch 300

# Automated validation
python scripts/deployment/validation/validate-config.py
