# Test Suite Execution Report

## Environment
- **Date**: 2025-09-20 13:36:12Z
- **Python**: 3.12.10 (from `pytest` session header)
- **Platform**: Linux (containerized CI environment)

## Commands Executed
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Installed application and testing dependencies successfully.
2. `python -m pytest tests/`
   - Attempted to run the complete pytest suite under the `tests/` directory.

## Outcome Summary
- **Overall Result**: ‚ùå Test execution failed during collection with 25 errors.
- **Pytest Output Highlights**:
  - Test session initialized with `pytest-8.4.1` and plugin `anyio-4.10.0`.
  - Collection stopped early due to import and dependency issues before any tests were executed.

## Detailed Failures
### Import Errors
- Multiple test modules failed to import `src.core.controllers.chat_controller` because the module performs a relative import (`from ...utils.logging import logger`) that resolves beyond the package root. This affects unit, integration, performance, and accessibility test suites.
- Example affected files:
  - `tests/unit/test_api_client_manager.py`
  - `tests/unit/test_chat_controller.py`
  - `tests/accessibility/test_wcag_compliance.py`
  - `tests/performance/test_ui_performance.py`

### Missing Dependencies
- `tests/integration/test_phase7_system_integration.py` and `tests/performance/test_performance_validation_phase7.py` require the `psutil` package, which is not listed in `requirements.txt`, leading to `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psutil'` during collection.

### Syntax Error in Test Suite
- `tests/integration/test_ui_chat_controller_integration.py` contains an `await` expression outside of an `async def` function, triggering a syntax error that prevents the file from importing.

### Additional Pytest Warnings
- Several tests in `tests/integration/test_scenarios_e2e_user_journeys.py` use the custom mark `@pytest.mark.e2e` without registering it, producing `PytestUnknownMarkWarning`. While not blocking execution, these warnings indicate missing mark configuration in `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml`.

## Next Steps
- Update `src/core/controllers/chat_controller.py` and related modules to avoid relative imports that traverse beyond the package root, or adjust the package structure to make those imports valid.
- Add `psutil` (and any other missing runtime dependencies) to `requirements.txt` or test-specific dependency files.
- Correct the asynchronous test in `tests/integration/test_ui_chat_controller_integration.py` to ensure that `await` statements appear within `async def` functions.
- Register the `e2e` pytest mark in the project's configuration to silence the warnings and clarify test categorization.
