# Test Suite Execution Report

## Environment
- **Date**: 2025-09-20 16:24:05Z (UTC)
- **Python**: 3.12.10 (pytest 8.4.1)
- **Platform**: Linux (containerized CI environment)

## Commands Executed
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Confirmed all runtime dependencies were present; `psutil` 7.1.0 was (re)installed.
2. `pip install -e .[test]`
   - Installed the project in editable mode alongside the pytest extras (`pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-cov`, `coverage`).
3. `python -m pytest`
   - Pytest collected **516 tests** but the process was terminated by the operating system with a `Killed` signal while executing `tests/unit/test_events.py` after ~4 minutes of CPU time.
   - Prior to termination, the live progress indicators showed numerous failures across the suite:
     - Accessibility: 3 failing checks in `tests/accessibility/test_wcag_compliance.py`.
     - Integration: `tests/integration/test_error_scenarios_phase7.py` (≈8 fails), `test_phase5_integration.py` (1 fail), `test_phase7_system_integration.py` (≈8 fails), `test_scenarios_e2e_user_journeys.py` (≈9 fails), `test_ui_chat_controller_integration.py` (≈5 fails).
     - Performance: `tests/performance/test_performance_validation_phase7.py` (≈9 fails) while `test_ui_performance.py` passed.
     - Unit: Failures observed in `test_api_client_manager.py` (4), `test_backup_manager.py` (2), `test_chat_controller.py` (10), `test_config_manager.py` (2), `test_conversation_manager.py` (1), `test_error_handler.py` (5), and `test_events.py` (at least 7 before termination). `test_chat_panel.py` and `test_conversation_storage.py` showed all passing indicators before the run stopped.
   - Because the runner was killed abruptly, pytest did **not** emit individual failure tracebacks or a summary table; deeper diagnostics require targeted re-runs.
4. `python -m pytest tests/accessibility/test_wcag_compliance.py -vv`
   - Targeted follow-up to capture at least one concrete failure reason: 3 tests failed because `InputPanel` lacks the `message_input` attribute expected by the accessibility checks.

## Outcome Summary
- **Overall Result**: ❌ Incomplete — full-suite run ended with an OS-level `Killed` signal before pytest could report totals or tracebacks.
- **Runtime**: ~4 minutes of execution prior to termination.
- **Impact**: Large portions of the integration, performance, and unit suites remain red; accessibility failures are confirmed via targeted rerun.

## Detailed Observations
### Accessibility Suite (`tests/accessibility/test_wcag_compliance.py`)
- The three failing cases (`test_aria_labels_and_roles`, `test_form_labels_and_associations`, `test_input_purpose_identification`) all assert that `self.ui.input_panel` exposes a `message_input` control. The implementation lacks this attribute, leading to immediate assertion failures.

### Integration & Performance Suites
- Progress output indicates concentrated failures across all Phase 5/7 integration flows, UI chat controller scenarios, and performance validation checks. Because the run stopped prematurely, failure stack traces were not captured. Expect fixture initialization issues and contract mismatches similar to prior runs; targeted reruns per module are required to gather specifics.

### Unit Suites
- Managers and controller modules (`APIClientManager`, `BackupManager`, `ChatController`, `ConfigManager`, `ConversationManager`, `ErrorHandler`, `Events`) all showed failing indicators before the runner was killed. No new stack traces were recorded; isolating each module with focused pytest commands is recommended to obtain actionable diagnostics.

### Run Termination
- The `Killed` signal occurred while executing `tests/unit/test_events.py`. This suggests either resource exhaustion (likely OOM) or watchdog intervention. No core dump or stderr message beyond `Killed` was emitted.

## Next Steps
- Investigate the cause of the OS-level termination (monitor memory usage during future runs or execute subsets to avoid OOM).
- Run failing suites individually to capture detailed stack traces (e.g., start with `tests/integration/test_phase7_system_integration.py` and `tests/unit/test_chat_controller.py`).
- Address the confirmed accessibility regression by exposing the `message_input` attribute (or updating the tests if expectations changed).
- Prioritize stabilization of integration fixtures (`full_system_app`, async manager setup) and event bus lifecycle handling identified by failing modules.

## Historical Comparison
- The previous documented run (2025-09-20 14:25:56Z) completed long enough to report 53 failures and 38 errors before being manually interrupted. The current attempt runs longer but ends abruptly due to an OS kill, preventing pytest from emitting aggregated statistics. Many of the previously reported problem areas remain unresolved.
