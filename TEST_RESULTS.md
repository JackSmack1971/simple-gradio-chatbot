# Test Suite Execution Report

## Environment
- **Date**: 2025-09-20 20:36:28Z (UTC)
- **Python**: 3.12.10 (pytest 8.4.1)
- **Platform**: Linux (containerized CI environment)
- **Pytest Plugins**: cov-7.0.0, asyncio-1.2.0

## Commands Executed
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Confirmed runtime dependencies were already satisfied in the environment.
2. `pip install -e .[test]`
   - Installed the project in editable mode along with testing extras (`pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-cov`, `coverage`).
3. `python -m pytest`
   - Pytest collected **517 tests** before execution began.
   - Numerous failures were reported across integration, performance, and unit suites prior to an OS-level `Killed` signal during `tests/unit/test_events.py`.

## Outcome Summary
- **Overall Result**: ❌ Incomplete — full-suite run terminated by the operating system after reporting multiple failures but before pytest could emit a summary table.
- **Termination Point**: The runner was killed while executing `tests/unit/test_events.py`.
- **Runtime Notes**: The test progress output advanced through 54% of the suite before the abrupt termination.

## Detailed Observations
### Accessibility Suite (`tests/accessibility/test_wcag_compliance.py`)
- All recorded cases passed in this run (no `F` markers observed).

### Integration Suite
- `tests/integration/test_error_scenarios_phase7.py`: 7 failing tests (`FFFFF.....F......F`).
- `tests/integration/test_phase5_integration.py`: 1 failing test (`.....F.......`).
- `tests/integration/test_phase7_system_integration.py`: 6 failing tests (`.FF..FF.F...F`).
- `tests/integration/test_scenarios_e2e_user_journeys.py`: 1 failing test (`..F.......`).
- `tests/integration/test_ui_chat_controller_integration.py`: 4 failing tests (`...F..FFF.....`).

### Performance Suite
- `tests/performance/test_performance_validation_phase7.py`: 1 failing test (`......F...`).
- `tests/performance/test_ui_performance.py`: All recorded cases passed (`..........`).

### Unit Suite
- `tests/unit/test_api_client_manager.py`: 4 failing tests (`..F..F....F......F......`).
- `tests/unit/test_backup_manager.py`: 2 failing tests (`...F......F.......`).
- `tests/unit/test_chat_controller.py`: All tests passed.
- `tests/unit/test_chat_panel.py`: All tests passed.
- `tests/unit/test_config_manager.py`: All tests passed.
- `tests/unit/test_conversation_manager.py`: 1 failing test (`....................F..`).
- `tests/unit/test_conversation_storage.py`: All tests passed.
- `tests/unit/test_error_handler.py`: 5 failing tests (`.F.....................FFFF`).
- `tests/unit/test_events.py`: 7 failing tests observed (`FFFFF.F............F`) before the OS terminated the run.

### Run Termination
- The `Killed` signal occurred while `tests/unit/test_events.py` was executing, preventing pytest from emitting detailed failure tracebacks or a final results table.

## Next Steps
- Investigate and mitigate the cause of the OS-level termination (potential resource exhaustion or watchdog timeout). Running targeted subsets or profiling memory usage may help isolate the issue.
- Address the failing tests enumerated above, starting with the most failure-dense modules (`tests/integration/test_error_scenarios_phase7.py`, `tests/unit/test_error_handler.py`, and `tests/unit/test_events.py`).
- Once stability is improved, re-run the full suite to obtain complete pytest summaries and ensure no additional failures appear beyond those recorded here.
