# Phase 7 System Integration Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive integration testing strategy for Phase 7: System Integration and Testing. The plan covers end-to-end validation of all system components working together, from user interface through application logic to external integrations.

## Test Objectives

1. **Component Integration**: Validate that all system layers (UI, Application Logic, Data Persistence, External Integration, Core Logic, Foundation) work together seamlessly
2. **End-to-End User Journeys**: Test complete user workflows from initial setup to advanced features
3. **Data Flow Validation**: Ensure data flows correctly through all system components
4. **Error Handling**: Verify robust error handling and recovery across all layers
5. **Performance Validation**: Confirm system meets performance baselines under various conditions
6. **Security Validation**: Ensure security measures work across integrated components
7. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Validate functionality across different environments

## Test Scope

5. **Settings Configuration**
   - Settings panel access → Changes → Persistence → Application restart

6. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - API failures → Retry logic → User feedback → Recovery
   - Network issues → Offline mode → Reconnection

7. **Advanced Features**
   - Multi-turn conversations → Branching → Export functionality

**Success Criteria**:

- File system problems (path issues, concurrent access)

**Success Criteria**:
- Errors handled gracefully without system crashes
- Appropriate user feedback provided
- Recovery mechanisms work as designed
- System remains stable after error conditions

### 5. Performance Integration Tests
**Objective**: Validate system performance under integrated conditions

**Test Scenarios**:
- Response time validation (simple/complex queries, streaming)
- Memory usage monitoring (under load, sustained operation)
- Concurrent operations handling
- Large conversation processing
- Startup and initialization performance

**Success Criteria** (based on performance-baselines.md):
- Response times < 10 seconds (typical), < 30 seconds (maximum)
- Memory usage < 500MB during normal operation
- Startup time < 5 seconds
- Model switching < 3 seconds
- Error recovery > 90% success rate

### 6. Security Integration Tests
**Objective**: Validate security measures across integrated components

**Test Scenarios**:
