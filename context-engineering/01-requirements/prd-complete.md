## Overview
The Personal AI Chatbot enables knowledge workers, independent creators, and customer-facing specialists to converse with OpenRouter-hosted large language models through a secure, responsive, and extensible chat workspace. The product focuses on rapid onboarding, transparent cost controls, and trustworthy data handling so that individuals can confidently incorporate generative AI into daily workflows without managing bespoke infrastructure.

## Business Context
### Problem Statement
Professionals increasingly rely on AI copilots to synthesize information and draft content, yet most hosted chat interfaces either lack data governance assurances or require engineering expertise to configure. Users need a turnkey assistant that respects privacy, supports multiple best-in-class models, and provides tooling to manage costs and audit usage.

### Strategic Objectives
1. **Accelerate adoption**: Deliver a self-serve assistant that reaches time-to-first-response under two minutes from initial visit.
2. **Increase productivity**: Reduce time spent on repetitive drafting and research tasks by at least 35% for primary personas within the first week of adoption.
3. **Ensure trust & compliance**: Provide auditable controls for API keys, conversation retention, and content exports that meet small-team governance expectations.
4. **Enable extensibility**: Offer configuration points for future integrations (knowledge bases, plugins) without re-architecting the solution.

### Success Metrics
- ≥ 85% weekly active user retention for first 90 days.
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) ≥ 45 after first month of usage.
- Support tickets related to onboarding or access < 2% of active users per month.
- System uptime ≥ 99.5% measured monthly.

- **End Users**: Knowledge workers using AI for productivity (Personas below).
- **Product Owner**: Defines roadmap and ensures compliance with requirements.
- **Security & Compliance Lead**: Approves data handling and encryption patterns.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Startup under 3 seconds (AC-001-01); UI load under 2 seconds (AC-001-02); API responses < 10 seconds (AC-005-01); maintain 95th percentile memory < 400 MB.

- **Usability**: Achieve SUS score ≥ 82; accessibility meets WCAG 2.1 AA (keyboard navigation, ARIA landmarks, color contrast ≥ 4.5:1).
- **Maintainability**: Codebase must achieve 85% unit test coverage and adopt automated linting/formatting; dependencies monitored monthly.
- **Observability**: Centralized logging with correlation IDs, metrics exported via OpenTelemetry, alert thresholds defined for latency and error rates.

## Business Rules & Constraints
1. Only OpenRouter API endpoints may be used for LLM interactions; no direct calls to provider APIs without routing through OpenRouter.
2. API keys are scoped per workspace; multiple keys per workspace allowed but only one active at a time.
3. Conversation retention defaults to 30 days; admins can shorten but not disable retention without explicit acknowledgment.
4. Maximum attachment size 5 MB; supported file types: `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`, `.json`.
5. Cost estimation uses provider pricing retrieved daily; cached values expire every 24 hours.
6. System must operate within $75/month infrastructure budget for MVP (excluding OpenRouter usage fees).
7. Localization initially supports English; additional locales require translation review and QA sign-off.

## Edge Cases & Error Scenarios
- Invalid API key formats, revoked keys, or exceeded OpenRouter quotas → show actionable error with remediation steps and disable send button until resolved.
- Network interruptions during streaming → pause indicator, automatic retry up to 3 attempts, ability for user to resume once connection restored.
- Model deprecation mid-session → notify user, auto-select recommended alternative, preserve unsent prompt.
- Large prompt exceeding context → display warning, highlight tokens to trim, and prevent send until user confirms summarization option.
- Attachment upload failures (size, virus detection) → reject with descriptive message and log event.
- Data corruption in local cache → fallback to remote fetch, clear corrupted entries, alert monitoring service.
- Browser session timeout → auto-save draft messages to local storage for 24 hours, prompt re-authentication.

## Integration Requirements
- **OpenRouter API**: REST endpoints `/models`, `/chat/completions`; use API key authentication; enable streaming via SSE/WebSocket fallback; handle rate limit headers.
- **Analytics & Telemetry**: Use OpenTelemetry exporters to send metrics/logs to Grafana Cloud; ensure sampling configurable per environment.
- **Email Service**: Integrate with Postmark for workspace invitations and alerts; utilize API keys stored in secrets manager.
- **Storage & Secrets**: Use platform-managed secrets (e.g., Fly.io secrets) and encrypted SQLite database backups stored in S3-compatible bucket.
- **Monitoring**: Configure health checks and uptime alerts via Better Stack; thresholds tied to latency and error rates defined above.

## Compliance & Security Requirements
- Comply with GDPR data subject rights: provide data export and deletion on request within 30 days.
- Maintain audit trail for retention policy changes and exports for minimum 12 months.
- Perform quarterly penetration testing and dependency vulnerability scans (Snyk/GitHub Dependabot).
- Enforce least-privilege access for admins; actions require multi-factor confirmation for retention overrides.
- All secrets stored using platform KMS; no plaintext logging; debug logs scrub PII and API keys.
- Display transparent privacy policy describing data handling; require explicit consent before storing transcripts longer than 30 days.
