## Architecture Overview

### System Context Diagram
```
[User] --> [Frontend] --> [API Gateway] --> [Backend Services] --> [Database]
```
<!-- Architecture Oracle will create detailed diagrams -->

### Architecture Patterns
- **Pattern**: [Selected architectural pattern]
- **Rationale**: [Why this pattern fits the requirements]
- **Trade-offs**: [Benefits and limitations]

## Component Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Hierarchy**: [Detailed component tree]
- **State Management**: [Global vs local state strategy]
- **Routing**: [Navigation and route structure]
- **Communication**: [API integration patterns]

### Backend Architecture
- **Service Structure**: [Microservices/monolith decision]
- **Layer Architecture**: [Presentation, business, data layers]
- **Communication**: [Inter-service communication patterns]
- **Data Flow**: [Request/response lifecycle]

## Data Architecture

### Database Design
- **Schema Strategy**: [Normalization approach]
- **Relationship Modeling**: [Entity relationships]
- **Indexing Strategy**: [Performance optimization]
- **Partitioning**: [Scalability considerations]

### Caching Architecture
- **Cache Layers**: [Application, database, CDN caching]
- **Cache Invalidation**: [Strategy and timing]
- **Performance Targets**: [Cache hit ratios, response times]

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Identity Management**: [User authentication strategy]
- **Access Control**: [Permission model and enforcement]
- **Token Management**: [JWT, session handling]

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: [At rest and in transit]
- **Input Validation**: [Sanitization and validation patterns]
- **Security Boundaries**: [Trust zones and validation points]

---
**Architecture Principles**: Scalability, maintainability, security, performance, and team productivity.
