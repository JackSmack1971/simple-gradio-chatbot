## Step-by-Step Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Project Setup (Week 1)

#### Day 1: Environment Setup
1. **Initialize Project Structure**
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app project-name --template typescript
   cd project-name
   # Follow exact folder structure from 04-standards/folder-structure.md
   ```

2. **Configure Development Tools**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev eslint prettier husky lint-staged
   # Configure according to 04-standards/coding-conventions.md
   ```

3. **Setup Git Workflow**
   ```bash
   git init
   # Follow git conventions from 04-standards/git-workflow.md
   ```

#### Day 2: Core Dependencies
1. **Install Production Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom @tanstack/react-query zustand
   # Install exact versions from 02-technology/dependency-matrix.md
   ```

2. **Install Development Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react jest-environment-jsdom
   # Configure testing according to 04-standards/testing-standards.md
   ```

#### Day 3-5: Infrastructure Setup
- Configure database connections
- Setup API route structure
- Implement authentication middleware
- Configure monitoring and logging

### Phase 2: Authentication System (Week 2)

#### Implementation Sequence
1. **Backend Authentication**
   - Implement JWT token generation
   - Create login/logout endpoints
   - Add password hashing
   - Setup refresh token mechanism

2. **Frontend Authentication**
   - Create login/register forms
   - Implement auth context
   - Add route protection
   - Handle token refresh

3. **Testing Authentication**
   - Unit tests for auth functions
   - Integration tests for auth flow
   - E2E tests for user journeys

### Quality Checkpoints
